# Youtube Downloader
This is a tool that allows the user to download a youtube video in different formats using the youtube URL. Like many other people, I ran into problems when using websites that are supposed to do this for you. Instead of trying to work around those websites, I decided I've had enough and made my own pythong program to do it for me. This takes a URL and converts it to either an mp3 or download the mp4 straight from youtube.

# How To Use
This is very simple. Install this git repository, and then run the program by typing 'python3 main.py' in the terminal. Then just follow the on screen steps and ez pz you now have your youtube video downloaded!
