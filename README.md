# Youtube Downloader
This is a tool that allows the user to download a youtube video in different formats using the youtube URL. Like many other people, I ran into problems when using websites that are supposed to do this for you. Instead of trying to work around those websites, I decided I've had enough and made my own pythong program to do it for me. This takes a URL and converts it to either an mp3 or download the mp4 straight from youtube.

# How To Use
This is very simple. First install the git repository. Then in your terminal, type 'pip install -r requirements.txt' After this type 'python main.py' Now just follow the on screen steps and you should have a downloaded youtube video!
